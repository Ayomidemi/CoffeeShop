# Getting Started

## Step 1: Clone the repo

To clone the repo you will:

```bash
# git clone
git clone git@github.com:Ayomidemi/CoffeeShop.git

# install all dependecies
yarn install

# on iOS
cd ios
pod install
cd ..

#on Amdroid
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

# Happy Coding!
